## Game Concept

Bugs. Bugs everywhere! Join Robak on her quest through the garden as she seeks to find what has been causing a disturbance within her homeland as well as the loss of her friends! Team up with ally bugs who will aid you by becoming unique living equipment to gain abilities such as hovering, digging and a sting that will leave even the mightiest of foes wincing. Traverse through this bouncy platforming adventure by avoiding obstacles while collecting life-giving pollen! 

Robak - Shadow of Moledor is a third-person 3D platformer made in Unreal Engine by De-Bug Studios. It will take place in an open world garden that is inhabited by the bug people. The player is one such being and has to befriend many of the bugs around them in order to gain powers and progress through the puzzle-platforming world. Their goal is to find what has been causing destruction in the garden and then stop it. To appeal to a family audience, the art style will include vibrant cel-shaded colours with cartoonish models and the language used will be simplistic. While ambitious, the game still falls within established gaming styles and is well within the ability of the team to produce - Our individual contributions to this end are detailed below.
