My name id Konrad Kowalewski and I am a programmer as well as a git master in my team and I was responsible for creating AI for our game. At the ending parts of a project I was responsible of playtesting of our game.

Our game uses simplistic but easy to create functionalities to create a interesting game. We have been creating Unreal Engine and C++ programming language in order to create our game as well as git for a version controll of our files on a bitbucket server.

The game's state now is more like prototype of possible outcome if we would have more time to polish things off, few features are created but not polished enough to be considered good enough to be put in our game. To my personal contributions to the project I can include being person responsible for all of the merges of the git repository which was very successful on my side as well as my AI design and its implementation of it using c++ code. The code on its own is very simplistic because of need to go back to the most stable version of it but a lot of my time took sorting out the ways how to implement it in many different ways. Main mistake that I have done is rather than using character type I have used a pawn that didn't allowed me to do things that I would want to do so with an enemy. This issue took me way too long to realise and it was way too late for me to prepare an newer revision of a script that I have done.
